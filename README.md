# rethge_torch
this repo contains help functions to convenient pytorch using. including plot, model train &amp; evaluate, results analysis and more...
those functions were wrote during my learning of pytorch, it can be directly use during to DeepLearning project development, and also using for learning purpose

some of funcs were adapted from this awesome tutorial: https://www.learnpytorch.io/ by Daniel Bourke, which is high recommend to check out

## install
`pip install rethge-torch`

## usage
`from rethge_torch import rethge`

  rethge.py includes help functions with:
  1. model related funcions (train/eval/test, )
  2. Utils related funcions (set seeds, choose GPU/CPU, clean CUDA cache)
  3. File manipulate related functions
  4. Plot related functions (loss curve, learning rate, image display...)
  5. Data load related functions
  6. result analyze/saving functions
